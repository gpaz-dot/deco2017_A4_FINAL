As part of the development process, several areas for improvement or extension have been identified. These recommendations aim to enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of the front-end database website. Consider the following suggestions for future development:
Implement advanced search features such as filtering, sorting, and faceted search to provide users with more refined and personalised search results.
Integrate a robust authentication and authorisation system to secure user data and enable role-based access control for different user types. This could also involve socials 

Explore the implementation of real-time updates using technologies like WebSockets or server-sent events to provide users with instant notifications and data updates.

Conduct performance profiling and implement optimisations such as caching strategies, code minification, and lazy loading to improve the website's loading speed and overall performance.

Enhance error handling mechanisms and implement robust logging to capture and track errors, helping to identify issues quickly and improve system stability.

Enable multi-language support to cater to a broader user base, allowing users to choose their preferred language and providing localised content.
Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to make the website accessible to users with disabilities, improving inclusivity and user satisfaction.

Expand the documentation to include comprehensive guides, tutorials, and a knowledge base to facilitate future development, maintenance, and onboarding of new developers.

Continuous Improvement: Foster a culture of continuous improvement by establishing feedback loops, conducting user testing, and gathering user feedback to drive ongoing enhancements and optimisations.
